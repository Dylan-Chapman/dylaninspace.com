title: How Relations Make Reality
pubDate: 2025-08-08
intro: We assume reality is a collection of objects with fixed properties. Modern physics tells a different story. Part one of this series introduces a relational worldview, where the universe is not a static stage but a dynamic web of interactions co-created from one moment to the next.

Our intuition paints a simple picture of the world: a vast stage populated by objects, each with its own definite properties. But for over a century, modern physics has been steadily eroding that picture. Time and space, once thought absolute, turned out to be flexible. Properties we assumed were built into objects themselves turned out to shift or take shape only in the context of interaction. Bit by bit, the classical image of inert objects in empty space has been undone.

From this erosion, a new principle emerges, most eloquently captured in John Wheeler’s notion of the _participatory universe_. Reality is not a pre-written book we passively discover, but a text co-authored in the act of interaction. The world is not made of _things with properties_ that then happen to relate; it is made of _relations that give rise to the appearance of things._

This series follows that single thread. It explores a worldview built not from objects with accidental ties, but from the fabric of interactions themselves. From modern physics to the emergence of life and mind, and ultimately to the phenomenon of conscious agency, we will see how far this relational principle can reach.

## Relativity and the Crumbling Stage

Our classical picture of the universe is a third-person account: a “view from nowhere,” where objects possess definite properties in an absolute space and time. But that stage began to crumble with Einstein. Relativity taught us that time and length are not fixed backgrounds but quantities defined with respect to an observer’s motion.

A familiar example is the atomic clocks on GPS satellites. They genuinely tick at a different rate than clocks on the ground, and must be continuously corrected to keep our navigation systems accurate. Time itself runs differently depending on how and where you move.

This leads to an even deeper break with intuition: the very idea of “now” is not universal. Two events that are simultaneous for one observer can occur at different times for another. This isn’t a trick of perception; it’s a structural feature of spacetime. And it has consequences: to measure the length of a moving train, you must mark the positions of its front and back _at the same instant._ But since observers in different states of motion disagree on what “the same instant” is, they will inevitably — and correctly — measure different lengths for the same train.

The same relational principle applies to fields. A stationary charge produces only an electric field. But if you move past it at high speed, you will also measure a magnetic field. What one observer calls “purely electric,” another calls a mixture of electric and magnetic. The division is not absolute; it depends on the relationship between the observer and the charge.

In every case, there is no single “true” reality waiting to be uncovered. Time, simultaneity, length, even the distinction between electricity and magnetism — all exist only as facts within the relationship between observer and observed.

## Quantum Relationalism

At the quantum level, this relational tendency deepens. A 2019 quantum optics experiment[^1] realizing the Wigner’s Friend thought experiment showed that different observers can record incompatible outcomes about the same event. These results violate a Bell-type inequality, forcing us to give up at least one of our core assumptions about reality:

- That physical properties exist independently of interaction (realism).
- That no influence can travel faster than light (locality).
- That experimenters can freely choose what to measure (freedom of choice).

Different interpretations of quantum mechanics make different sacrifices to navigate this forced choice. **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)**, for instance, preserves locality and freedom of choice by giving up absolute realism. Other views, like Bohmian mechanics, preserve realism but give up locality, while the Many-Worlds Interpretation preserves both by sacrificing the idea of a single, definite outcome for any event.

On the relational view, a definite property is not _revealed_ but _brought into being through interaction_: a correlation established only relative to the systems involved. This is a direct expression of fundamental **underdetermination**: the state of the world at one moment does not contain enough information to fully fix its state at the next. Instead, relations actualize possibilities in context. The **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** makes this vivid. An experiment designed to pin down a particle’s position establishes a sharp correlation in space, but at the same time leaves its momentum unconstrained—the range of its possible values widens. An experiment that sharpens momentum instead blurs position. What we get is not a particle “smeared out” in space, but a shifting landscape of potential outcomes that changes with the kind of interaction we choose.

This reveals something fundamental: **relationalism doesn’t just make properties relative — it makes the very space of possibilities relational.** Reality is neither arbitrary nor rigid; its contours shift with context, its futures shaped but not predetermined. Each interaction both constrains and opens, carving one path while leaving others behind. To say the world is relational is not only to say that outcomes depend on context, but that possibility itself is woven from context.

This suggests a final, radical step: the universe’s fundamental constituents are not “systems” that _have_ relations, but relations that _generate systems_. Particles, fields, even spacetime itself can be seen as enduring knots in this fabric of becoming — patterns that persist, for a time, within the unfolding network of constraints and correlations.

## The Stickiness of Facts

If facts are created in fleeting interactions, why is the world so stable? Once a new fact comes into being, it ripples outward, weaving its correlation into the wider environment through a process called **decoherence**. This spreading stabilizes the fact, making it effectively irreversible.

In concrete terms, imagine a photon bouncing off a surface. The fact of its reflection doesn’t remain local. It’s imprinted in the photon’s new path, in the recoil of the surface, in the vibrations of surrounding air molecules, in the detectors that register it. At each step, the correlation spreads further, until countless systems carry its trace. The world remembers — each interaction leaves a trace, woven into the broader fabric of correlations. To undo the fact, you would need to reverse not only the photon’s path but also the entire chain of correlations that followed — a feat as fantastical as un-shattering a glass. This is a quantum mechanism that underpins the _emergence_ of the thermodynamic arrow of time, giving facts their persistence and the past its solidity.

This provides a powerful new way to understand even our most basic experiences. The solidity of the ground we stand on, for instance, is not the property of some indivisible, static “substance.” It is the macroscopic experience of an unfathomably dense and self-consistent network of correlations. The ground is “solid” to us because our bodies couple strongly to its lattice of relations, making it statistically impossible for its structure to yield to ours. But this solidity is not absolute. To a neutrino, which interacts only faintly, the same ground is almost ghostlike. To an X-ray photon, it is semi-permeable, absorbed and scattered only at certain resonances. The matter itself does not change; what changes is how different probes participate in it. Solidity is not a fixed property of matter, but a relational achievement: the experiential sense of a consensus that arises only within certain scales and modes of interaction.

## The Geometry of Relation

But if reality is just a relational fabric, what gives it structure? Why does it form into discrete objects that take up space? The answer is not an externally imposed rule, but lies in the fundamental **geometry of the relations themselves.** For our purposes, there are two primary types of relational geometry a pattern can have with the universe around it.

The first, simpler type is **“smooth.”** A pattern with this geometry is like a simple, untwisted loop. A single 360-degree turn of its quantum state brings it back to its original condition, just as with objects in our everyday experience. These patterns are what constitute **forces and interactions** (like photons), and we call them **bosons**. Because their relational geometry is simple, they can constructively combine and “stack” in the same state. A laser is a perfect example: trillions of photons sharing the same relational state, behaving as one coherent wave.

The other type of relation is inherently **“twisted.”** A pattern with this geometry is like a Möbius strip: you have to rotate its quantum state a full 720 degrees to return to your starting point. These topologically complex, twisted patterns are what constitute **matter** (electrons, quarks), and we call them **fermions**. This built-in twist has a profound consequence: when two identical fermions attempt to occupy the same state, their twists forbid them from overlapping. They must differentiate, each carving out its own distinct configuration.

This is the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, and it is the ultimate source of all structure. The shells of electrons in an atom are not arbitrary architecture but the relational necessity that each electron carve out its own unique place. Matter has volume and form because its constituent patterns cannot collapse into sameness.

The structure of our world, then, is the emergent consequence of a deep symmetry at the heart of reality: a universe woven from smooth relations that unify and twisted relations that individuate. At every level, what we call matter and force are nothing but **the geometry of relation itself**.

## An Intrinsic Nature

This brings us to a final, deep question about the relational fabric of reality. Physics excels at describing its extrinsic patterns and structures, but it leaves untouched the intrinsic character of those patterns. Put differently: what is it like to be an interaction? Why is there someone home in the first place? Why do we not simply exist as inert patterns, but as patterns that feel and witness themselves?

A powerful starting point here is the philosophical framework of **Russellian Monism**[^2][^3][^4]. It holds that physics gives us only the structural profile of the world, not its intrinsic nature. On this view, the intrinsic is what the structure is made of — the hidden qualities implicit in its behavior, and consciousness reveals this otherwise hidden dimension.

The worldview developed in this essay takes that idea a step further. It asks: what if the structure is not grounded in some further intrinsic base at all? What if the “intrinsic” is simply the world as lived from the inside of its relations? To be a relation is already to have an experiential aspect, however minimal; to describe that relation externally is to capture only its extrinsic pattern. The degree of experiential richness scales with the complexity, integration, and self-reflexivity of the relational network: most relations are nearly silent, while some, like those in brains, resound in full harmony.

Music offers a useful example. What we call a “song” is nothing apart from the interplay of rhythm, harmony, and melody. From one angle, we can capture those relations as notation (the extrinsic description). From another, we live them directly as sound (the experiential aspect). There is no hidden “thing” beneath the music—only the relational process itself, heard or analyzed.

This reframing resolves the question of “physical stuff.” On this view, the physical world is not a hidden substrate on which structures are imposed. The physical world is the relational process itself. The fabric of reality is not inert matter, but active, experiential becoming.

This suggests that the universe is not made of mindless “stuff” that miraculously produces experience only in rare arrangements like brains. Instead, the fundamental fabric of reality may already carry a proto-experiential character — not a rich consciousness, but the faintest interiority from which richer forms can emerge. The vast, unthinking cosmos and the vibrant, conscious mind are not made of two different realities, but of one and the same dual-aspect process—differing only in the richness, reflexivity, and complexity of their relational patterns.

## A New Foundation

The picture that emerges is not a final answer, but a new foundation. Step by step, the absolutes of the classical world dissolve into patterns of relation: time and length into relative measures, quantum outcomes into context-dependent correlations, structure itself into the geometry of relation, and experience into the interior aspect of those same processes. What remains is a participatory universe, woven not from inert things but from a shimmering, creative fabric of interactions.

This view, built from the insights of modern physics, finds a profound echo in Western **process philosophy**, particularly in the work of Alfred North Whitehead, who argued for a universe built from dynamic “events” rather than static “things.” It also resonates with deep currents in Eastern thought, such as the Buddhist principle of **Dependent Origination** (`pratītyasamutpāda`), which holds that no phenomenon has an independent existence, but arises only within a web of universal interconnectedness.

But if this is the stage, who are the actors? The next part of this series will explore how stable, unified selves can emerge and persist within this dynamic, relational world.
