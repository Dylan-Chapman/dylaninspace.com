title: How Relations Make Reality
pubDate: 2025-08-08
intro: We assume reality is a collection of objects with fixed properties. Modern physics tells a different story. Part one of this series introduces a relational worldview, where the universe is not a static stage but a dynamic web of interactions co-created from one moment to the next.

Our intuition paints a simple picture of the world: a vast stage populated by objects, each with its own definite properties. But for over a century, modern physics has been steadily eroding that picture. Time and space, once thought absolute, turned out to be flexible. Properties we assumed were built into objects themselves turned out to shift or take shape only in the context of interaction. Bit by bit, the classical image of inert objects in empty space has been undone.

From this erosion, a new principle emerges, most eloquently captured in John Wheeler’s notion of the _participatory universe_. Reality is not a pre-written book we passively discover, but a text co-authored in the act of interaction. The world is not made of _things with properties_ that then happen to relate; it is made of _relations that give rise to the appearance of things._

This series follows that single thread. It explores a worldview built not from objects with accidental ties, but from the fabric of interactions themselves. From modern physics to the emergence of life and mind, and ultimately to the phenomenon of conscious agency, we will see how far this relational principle can reach.

## Relativity and the Crumbling Stage

Our classical picture of the universe is a third-person account: a “view from nowhere,” where objects possess definite properties in an absolute space and time. But that stage began to crumble with Einstein. Relativity taught us that time and length are not fixed backgrounds but quantities defined with respect to an observer’s motion.

A familiar example is the atomic clocks on GPS satellites. They genuinely tick at a different rate than clocks on the ground, and must be continuously corrected to keep our navigation systems accurate. Time itself runs differently depending on how and where you move.

This leads to an even deeper break with intuition: the very idea of “now” is not universal. Two events that are simultaneous for one observer can occur at different times for another. This isn’t a trick of perception; it’s a structural feature of spacetime. And it has consequences: to measure the length of a moving train, you must mark the positions of its front and back _at the same instant._ But since observers in different states of motion disagree on what “the same instant” is, they will inevitably — and correctly — measure different lengths for the same train.

The same relational principle applies to fields. A stationary charge produces only an electric field. But if you move past it at high speed, you will also measure a magnetic field. What one observer calls “purely electric,” another calls a mixture of electric and magnetic. The division is not absolute; it depends on the relationship between the observer and the charge.

This pattern extends even to the vacuum itself. What one observer describes as empty space, another — accelerating rapidly — experiences as a warm bath of particles. In this view, the very existence of particles is not absolute, but a relational fact, dependent on one’s state of motion.

In every case, there is no single “true” reality waiting to be uncovered. Time, simultaneity, length, fields, even the presence of particles themselves — all exist only within the relationship between observer and observed.

## Relationality in the Quantum World

At the quantum level, this relational tendency deepens. A 2019 quantum optics experiment[^1] realizing the Wigner’s Friend thought experiment showed that different observers can record incompatible outcomes about the same event. These results violate a Bell-type inequality, forcing us to give up at least one of our core assumptions about reality:

- That physical properties exist independently of interaction (realism).
- That no influence can travel faster than light (locality).
- That experimenters can freely choose what to measure (freedom of choice).

Different interpretations of quantum mechanics make different sacrifices to navigate this forced choice. **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)**, for instance, preserves locality and freedom of choice by giving up absolute realism. Other views, like Bohmian mechanics, preserve realism but give up locality, while the Many-Worlds Interpretation preserves both by sacrificing the idea of a single, definite outcome for any event.

On the relational view, a definite property is not _revealed_ but _brought into being through interaction_: a correlation established only relative to the systems involved. This is a direct expression of fundamental **underdetermination**: the state of the world at one moment does not contain enough information to fully fix its state at the next. Instead, relations actualize possibilities in context. The **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** makes this vivid. An experiment designed to pin down a particle’s position establishes a sharp correlation in space, but at the same time leaves its momentum unconstrained—the range of its possible values widens. An experiment that sharpens momentum instead blurs position. What we get is not a particle “smeared out” in space, but a shifting landscape of potential outcomes that changes with the kind of interaction we choose.

This reveals something fundamental: **relationalism doesn’t just make properties relative — it makes even the landscape of possibilities relational, shifting with the context of interaction.** Reality is neither arbitrary nor rigid; its contours shift with context, its futures shaped but not predetermined. Each interaction both constrains and opens, carving one path while leaving others behind. To say the world is relational is not only to say that outcomes depend on context, but that possibility itself is woven from context.

This suggests a final, radical step: the universe’s fundamental constituents are not “systems” that _have_ relations, but relations that _generate systems_. Particles, fields, even spacetime itself can be seen as enduring knots in this fabric of becoming — patterns that persist, for a time, within the unfolding network of constraints and correlations.

## How the World Remembers

Still, if correlations only arise in fleeting interactions, why isn’t the world a blur of constant reconfiguration? What mechanism allows certain outcomes to endure and accumulate into the stable order we experience? Once a new correlation comes into existence, it ripples outward through **decoherence**, stitching itself into the wider environment. In concrete terms, imagine a photon, the minimal relational packet of the electromagnetic field and what we ordinarily call a particle of light, bouncing off a surface. The trace of its reflection doesn’t remain local; it is carried in the photon’s new path, in the recoil of the surface, in the vibrations of surrounding air molecules. Step by step, the imprint multiplies, until countless systems carry its echo. This cascade stabilizes the record, making it irreversible in practice, though not in principle. This is the machinery behind the local arrow of time: each interaction leaves an enduring trace, and to undo it would require unweaving the entire tapestry of correlations—a feat as fantastical as un-shattering a glass. The past, in this view, is nothing but the ever-thickening fabric of such traces.

This local, moment-to-moment arrow operates within a larger, **cosmological one**. Physicists often describe the universe’s overall directionality in terms of the Second Law of Thermodynamics: it began in an extraordinarily ordered, low-entropy state and has been moving toward higher entropy ever since. From the process perspective we’ve been describing, this initial order need not be a fine-tuned miracle. A young cosmos is naturally low in structure, and its growth over billions of years has opened vast new possibilities for complexity and, ultimately, entropy to accumulate. Decoherence, then, is the pen that writes the record of history, while cosmic expansion provides the scroll on which that record unfolds.

## The Geometry of Relation

But if reality is just a relational fabric, what gives it structure? Why does it form into discrete objects that take up space? The answer is not an externally imposed rule, but lies in the fundamental **geometry of the relations themselves.** For our purposes, there are two primary types of relational geometry a pattern can have with the universe around it.

The first type is **cyclic and smooth.** If you rotate the pattern once (a full 360°), it returns to its original orientation. These are **bosons**, such as photons, which mediate the electromagnetic interaction. Their smooth geometry allows them to combine in the same state, amplifying one another into powerful collective patterns. A laser is a perfect example: trillions of photons sharing the same relational state, behaving as a single coherent wave.

The second type is **cyclic but twisted.** A single 360° turn does not bring the pattern back to itself but inverts it. Only after 720° does it return to the starting point. These are **fermions**, such as electrons and quarks, which make up matter. This built-in twist has a profound consequence: two identical fermions cannot collapse into the same configuration. Each must differentiate, carving out its own unique place.

This is the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, and it is one of the deepest sources of structure in the world. Without it, electrons would all collapse into the same state and atoms would have no architecture. Pauli exclusion, working together with electric repulsion, forces each electron to carve out its own niche. The result is the layered shells of atoms, the stability of bulk matter, and the sheer fact that the world takes up space.

The structure of our world, then, is the emergent consequence of a deep symmetry at the heart of reality: a universe woven from smooth relations that unify and twisted relations that individuate. At every level, what we call matter and force are nothing but **the geometry of relation itself.**

## An Intrinsic Nature

Up to this point, our journey has followed the contours of physics, revealing a world where structure and relation are primary. But this picture, radical as it is, leaves one kind of question unanswered that is outside the purview of physics. What follows, then, is a step from physics into philosophy, to ask: what is it like to be an interaction? Why is there someone home in the first place? Why do we not simply exist as inert patterns, but as patterns that feel and witness themselves?

A powerful starting point here is the philosophical framework of **Russellian Monism**[^2][^3][^4]. It holds that physics gives us only the structural profile of the world, not its intrinsic nature. On this view, the intrinsic is what the structure is made of — the hidden qualities implicit in its behavior, and consciousness reveals this otherwise hidden dimension.

The worldview developed in this essay takes that idea a step further. It asks: what if the structure is not grounded in some further intrinsic base at all? What if the “intrinsic” is simply the world as lived from the inside of its relations? To be a relation is already to have an experiential aspect, however minimal; to describe that relation externally is to capture only its extrinsic pattern. The degree of experiential richness scales with the complexity, integration, and self-reflexivity of the relational network: most relations are nearly silent, while some, like those in brains, resound in full harmony.

Music offers a useful example. What we call a “song” is nothing apart from the interplay of rhythm, harmony, and melody. From one angle, we can capture those relations as notation (the extrinsic description). From another, we live them directly as sound (the experiential aspect). There is no hidden “thing” beneath the music—only the relational process itself, heard or analyzed.

This reframing resolves the question of “physical stuff.” On this view, the physical world is not a hidden substrate on which structures are imposed. The physical world is the relational process itself. The fabric of reality is not inert matter, but active, experiential becoming.

This suggests that the universe is not made of mindless “stuff” that miraculously produces experience only in rare arrangements like brains. Instead, the fundamental fabric of reality already carries a proto-experiential character. The vast, unthinking cosmos and the vibrant, conscious mind are not made of two different realities, but of one and the same dual-aspect process—differing only in the richness, reflexivity, and complexity of their relational patterns.

## A New Foundation

Tracing this thread doesn't tie everything up. But it does leave us with a coherent, if radical, new foundation. It paints a picture of a participatory universe, built not of things, but of a shimmering, creative network of relations. It is a world where the future is genuinely open, composed of countless, shifting landscapes of possibility, each shaped by context. And it is a world that may be experiential all the way down.

This view, built from the insights of modern physics, finds a profound echo in Western **process philosophy**, particularly in the work of Alfred North Whitehead, who argued for a universe built from dynamic “events” rather than static “things.” It also resonates with deep currents in Eastern thought, such as the Buddhist principle of **Dependent Origination** (`pratītyasamutpāda`), which holds that no phenomenon has an independent existence, but arises only within a web of universal interconnectedness.

But if this is the stage, who are the actors? The next part of this series will explore how stable, unified selves can emerge and persist within this dynamic, relational world.
