In the first part of this series, we explored a relational view of reality—one where the future is not a pre-written script, but contains genuine openness that is resolved through interaction. In the second, we saw how selves emerge as coherent, self-sustaining patterns within this dynamic fabric.

We now turn to how such selves act. A self can hold itself together yet remain passive, tracing whatever path the world imposes on it.

To shape its own future, something more is needed — a way to seize the openness within its own dynamics and use it as leverage for change.

## The First Spark of Choice

If the universe were a clockwork machine of pre-written facts, nothing could ever truly choose. But its fundamental character is relational: facts are not passively revealed, but actively created in the moment of interaction. This constant creation of new facts from unresolved possibilities provides the "causal slack"—the raw material—for genuine agency to emerge.

## Agency as Informational Steering

Brains are exactly the kind of system poised to leverage this slack. They operate in a regime where small fluctuations matter enormously.

- **Thermal fluctuations at body temperature** inject timing variability into otherwise lawful processes. Molecules are constantly jostling, creating tiny variations in when ion channels open, how quickly neurotransmitters diffuse, and the precise moment a neuron fires. This doesn't make the brain lawless, but it makes its future states fundamentally unpredictable from its past, providing a constant stream of small uncertainties that can be amplified.

- **Chaotic dynamics** in neural networks mean that these small differences can cascade into large behavioral changes. This sensitivity gives the brain tremendous leverage over its own future states.

- **Critical dynamics**—operating near the boundary between rigid order and total chaos—allow local events to have global consequences without destroying the coherence of the whole.

Together, these features act as powerful amplifiers, enabling coherent, holistic patterns of information to draw on the underlying indeterminacy of the world as raw material. The system doesn't just select from pre-existing options—it actively aligns unresolved micro-possibilities into new coordinated macro-behavior, creating order that did not exist at the level of the parts.

## Downward Constraints in Action

This combination creates something genuinely new in the universe: downward informational causation. The higher-level pattern doesn't just emerge from lower-level dynamics; it **recruits** those dynamics to serve its own persistence and goals.

Consider deciding to reach for coffee. The holistic, informational pattern of that decision doesn't just respond to the noise in the brain—it draws upon the "causal slack" of unresolved micro-possibilities as raw material, actively **aligning them to impose a new, coordinated order** that did not exist at the level of the individual parts.

Let's connect this back to the **intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives** we explored in Part 1. The "informational pattern" is the extrinsic, physical description of what is intrinsically the subjective experience of deciding. The belief "I need caffeine" is **both** a coherent constraint that leverages this underlying indeterminacy to channel neural activity, **and** the lived experience of choosing from the inside.

This stands in sharp contrast to the conventional scientific view. In that picture, the "decision" is an emergent but ultimately epiphenomenal summary of a complex, bottom-up process. It’s a useful description, but the _real_ causation remains at the micro-level. The framework presented here suggests something more radical: the holistic pattern—the intrinsic experience of choosing—is a new and real causal level in its own right. It doesn't violate the lower-level laws, but harnesses and organizes them in a way they could not achieve on their own.

This phenomenon—where a higher-level description of a system has more predictive and causal power than a lower-level one—has a formal name in information science: **causal emergence**. It provides a measurable, third-person account of when a holistic pattern becomes a genuine cause.

## The Universe's Point of View

Within the universe's process of becoming, certain patterns of exceptional complexity have emerged—patterns that build internal, predictive models of the whole.

We call these patterns minds. They are the universe's way of developing a point of view on itself.

If this framework is taken seriously, it forces us to re-examine our deepest assumptions about time, space, and personal identity. But those will be stories for another day.
