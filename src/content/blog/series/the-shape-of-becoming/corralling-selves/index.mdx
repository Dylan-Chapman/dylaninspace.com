intro: When reality blooms event by event, selves are the patterns that learn to hold it together. This chapter climbs the ladder from bare relations to integrated boundaries, tracing how memory, constraint, and coherence corral possibility into the first glimmers of mind.

Two common intuitions, inherited from classical physics, frame how we picture reality:

- A **Platonic view**, where the laws of physics and all possible states exist timelessly in an abstract mathematical space.
- A **Block Universe view**, where spacetime itself is a fixed four-dimensional entity. Past, present, and future are all equally real, and the passage of time is just our consciousness moving across a pre-written script.

Both of these portray reality as static. But alternative proposals — such as **Causal Set Theory** and **Lee Smolin’s “temporal naturalism”** — suggest something more dynamic. On this view (speculative, not consensus), the only timeless rule may be causality itself. The laws of physics are not eternal truths fetched from a Platonic heaven, but may instead be emergent _habits_ of a universe that is constantly growing and defining itself. In Causal Set Theory, spacetime is modeled as a discrete causal order that literally grows by adding new “atoms” of spacetime over time[^10]. This naturally echoes the “growing block” universe view, in which the past and present exist but the future is not yet real[^11].

Instead of a pre-carved block, imagine an infinite block of marble where the sculptor’s tools are causality and conservation. Each new event is a strike of the chisel, making one path actual and carving away the infinity of other paths that might have been. This dynamic foundation will be our starting point.

From here, we can shift focus from what is possible to how possibility becomes structured. If new facts are constantly being created, then some of them must start to constrain others. Clusters of events begin holding traces of their own history, shaping what can come next. It is from this slow accumulation of structure that the first glimmers of information-processing behavior emerge.

## The Ladder of Emergence

We can picture the bridge from a single event to the integrated reality of a mind as a **ladder of emergence**, with each rung showing how information becomes more organized and self-sustaining.

### Level 1: A Relation — The Foundation

At the most fundamental level, the universe is composed of discrete causal events. An event is not a thing, but an interaction — a relation being formed. This is the most basic form of information: a “difference that makes a difference.” On this framework we need not assume that a single, simple event has any intrinsic experience (avoiding panpsychist overreach). The core claim is simply that reality is built from these relations. The universe is a network of interactions, not a collection of tiny billiard balls, and this relational structure is the ground floor for everything that follows.

### Level 2: Persistent Patterns — Memory

For information to matter, it must persist. A rock has a passive “memory” encoded in its repetitive structure. A brain, through synaptic plasticity, has a far more dynamic memory, where its past experiences reshape the probabilities of its future behavior. Memory marks the transition from isolated facts to structures that accumulate history.

### Level 3: Constraint Navigation — Computation

With memory in place, a system can perform computation: using stored information to guide future actions. A bacterium navigating a chemical gradient is performing basic computation. A nervous system running complex internal simulations to choose between possible futures is performing advanced computation. Computation is what lets a system begin to steer its path through the space of possibility.

### Level 4: Informational Boundary — The Self

A **self** emerges when computation becomes so integrated that it forms a coherent, self-sustaining informational boundary — a structure able to preserve its own organization across time. This is the architectural basis for what we call a **mind**, though not yet an agent.

This requires an integrative medium — such as the brain’s fast, high-bandwidth electrical activity (a live hypothesis, not established consensus) — that allows global, holistic information states to form.

Bioelectric fields are not unique to neurons; developmental biology shows they act as instructive signals guiding morphogenesis across tissues[^6]. In the brain, oscillating electric fields may also synchronize distant neurons through ephaptic coupling, binding them into coherent networks[^7]. The “Self” is this circulating, self-modeling pattern, an informational loop that distinguishes what is inside it from what is outside.

## A Gradient of Unity

The emergence of an integrated self requires a shift in perspective. A mind is not made by “adding up” trillions of micro-experiences. Instead, a mind is a new informational entity, a pattern that comes into being when many parts become so tightly coupled that they behave as one.

Subjectivity is not a binary switch but a **gradient**, and its character can be radically different from our own. Its intensity depends on the speed, bandwidth, and coherence of the system’s integrative medium:

- A **human brain**, with its fast, high-bandwidth dynamics, achieves extreme integration. This produces a sharply defined, coherent self with a unified point of view.
- An **ant colony**, coordinated by pheromone trails and local signals, forms a slower, more diffuse “liquid brain.” Research in collective cognition supports this view: ant colonies integrate information and make group-level decisions like a brain, and some theorists even argue they may qualify as basic conscious systems[^1]. Even slime molds, though single-celled, show learning, memory, and problem-solving without neurons[^2].
- A **corporation** relies on low-bandwidth, high-latency symbolic integration (laws, language, data). Its components retain too much autonomy for a unified subjectivity to emerge. While the corporation acts as an agent in the world, it lacks a coherent inner life.

This reveals a fundamental challenge of emergence: creating and maintaining a unified self becomes exponentially more difficult as the number of components and the distances between them increase. True integration is rare and remarkable.

This structural unity marks the threshold of **cognition** — the ability to process information about the world — but not yet of **agency**, the ability to reshape what happens next.

## The Dissipation of the Self

This view of the self as an active, energy-intensive achievement leads to a striking conclusion: the self can also come undone. The sharpness of our subjectivity is not a given; it is a measure of how successfully the pattern maintains its coherence. The journey of a self is a dynamic arc; its fading is as natural as its formation.

We see this in neurodegenerative diseases, where the degradation of the brain’s hardware makes it impossible to sustain the coherent pattern of the self. We also see it in deep meditative states, where the self-modeling process is intentionally quieted, allowing the boundary of the ego to temporarily and safely dissolve. The self’s existence is not guaranteed — it must be continuously maintained through the active work of integration.

The emergence of a self brings coherence — a boundary able to preserve and integrate its own structure. But coherence alone does not make a mind. A system can be unified yet inert, its future fixed like a clockwork machine.

To act — to carve new futures rather than replay old ones — requires more than structure. It requires _openness_: unresolved possibilities the system can shape.

**Consciousness**, in this sense, is not something added to the integrated self but the self's inner face: what its coherence feels like from the inside. **Agency** is the outward reach of that inner face, the power to impose new constraints on the world.

How such selves gain that power will be the question of the next part.
