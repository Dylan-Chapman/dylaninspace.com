## Agency and the Shaping of Possibility

In the last part, we explored how facts themselves arise only in relation. A particle’s position, an electron’s spin, a photon’s path — none of these exist universally, waiting to be revealed. They are created in interaction, crystallizing what was previously unresolved.

That same principle extended beyond the quantum scale. Cells and organisms don’t simply register correlations with their environment; they navigate constraint landscapes. A bacterium compares concentrations across time; a human weighs memories, forecasts, and social norms. In each case, the world becomes definite not all at once, but step by step, through recognition and response.

This theme echoes [John Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler)'s notion of a _participatory universe_: reality does not lie dormant, waiting to be revealed, but crystallizes through acts of interaction. Wheeler imagined this in cosmological terms, with observers woven into the fabric of the universe itself. Here, I’m drawing out a parallel on the more local scale — where facts arise relationally in quantum mechanics and ripple upward into the fabric of recognition and agency.

But this raises a deeper question: if selves emerge as coherent patterns in this relational web, how do they act upon it?

## The Puzzle of Doing

It is one thing to persist as a stable pattern — like a whirlpool in a river, sustained by flow but without altering the water’s course. It is another to shape one’s own trajectory.

Where does that capacity come from?

In a strictly deterministic cosmos, agency is an illusion. The present state of the world dictates the next with clockwork necessity; the sense of “choosing” is just ignorance of the gears. In a purely random cosmos, agency fares no better. If events unfold by chance, then action is arbitrary, not owned.

The challenge is to understand how real agency can exist in a universe that is neither rigidly determined nor chaotically free-floating.

## Openness at the Foundations

Relational quantum mechanics suggests a way through. At the most fundamental level, the future is not a single, pre-written script but a branching landscape of possibilities. This indeterminacy is a core feature of our universe, formalized in concepts like the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**, which confirms that what exists prior to interaction is not a set of hidden facts but a field of unresolved, probabilistic outcomes.

This principle of fundamental openness is key. Separately, in the biological world, we find systems—nervous systems in particular—that are poised at a delicate balance point. They are rife with what appears to be classical noise and sensitivity: the thermal jitter of ion channels, the probabilistic release of neurotransmitters.

In a clockwork, deterministic universe, this sensitivity would be a flaw, a source of error to be suppressed. But in a universe with genuine, fundamental openness, it becomes a powerful resource. This is what [George Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._R._Ellis) calls _causal slack_: the space higher-level structures have to steer outcomes that are not rigidly dictated from below. The brain’s sensitive dynamics leverage this slack to navigate the landscape of branching possibilities, tilting probabilities toward coherent trajectories.

## The Stickiness of Facts

Once a new fact comes into being through interaction, it does not remain confined to the two systems that first correlated. The outcome ripples outward as each system interacts with others, weaving the correlation into the wider environment. This spreading does not create the fact—it stabilizes it, making it effectively irreversible. From then on, any system that later connects into that web will encounter the same correlation, because the alternatives have been pushed beyond reach.

In relational terms, decoherence is the process of a correlation network widening through interaction until reversal becomes impossible. The fact persists not because it was always written, but because undoing it would require re-cohering the entire chain of interactions—a feat as statistically impossible as un-shattering a glass. This is the quantum mechanism that underpins the thermodynamic arrow of time, giving facts their persistence and the past its solidity.

This stickiness is what makes agency possible. Minds can only steer futures if the facts they create persist long enough to be built upon. Relational decoherence provides that persistence: once a decision is made, the correlations it sets in motion stabilize into the environment, becoming reliable material for further choice.

## Brains as Probability Sculptors

Brains, in particular, seem tuned to the edge of predictability:

**Fluctuations as fuel.** At body temperature, molecular jostling introduces micro-scale variations into neural activity.

**Sensitivity to timing.** Small differences — a synapse firing a few milliseconds earlier or later — can ripple through networks, altering which thoughts surface, which memories are primed, which actions follow.

**Criticality.** Neural dynamics hover near a phase transition between order and chaos. Too rigid, and the system cannot adapt; too unstable, and coherence disintegrates. At criticality, local nudges can propagate globally without dissolving structure.

Taken together, these features make brains into sculptors of probability. They do not dictate exact outcomes, but they tilt landscapes of possibility, biasing some trajectories while suppressing others.

## The Shape of Downward Causation

This is where agency takes root.

In physics, we usually think of causation flowing “upward”: particles make atoms, atoms make molecules, molecules make neurons, neurons make thoughts. But in complex systems, the whole can also constrain the parts.

This is downward causation — not by overriding laws, but by shaping the space in which micro-events play out. A whirlpool channels water molecules into a spiral; the spiral doesn’t force any molecule, but it organizes them into a collective pattern.

In the brain, intentions act in a similar way. The decision to reach for coffee does not command particular neurons to fire. Instead, it biases the system: attention shifts toward the cup, motor circuits enter a state of readiness, memories of taste and habit come online. Countless micro-possibilities are nudged into coherence, until the act of reaching unfolds as the most probable trajectory.

From the outside, this looks like a cascade of neural firings. From the inside, it is what we experience as choosing.

## Leaning Into the Flux

Agency is not a push against physics. It is a way of leaning into the universe’s openness.

A sailor cannot command the wind, but by holding a heading and adjusting the sails, they harness its variability. The gusts are not obstacles — they are the very medium of navigation.

So too with selves. The openness seeded by quantum indeterminacy, carried upward through noise and criticality, is not something to be eliminated. It is what makes steering possible.

Randomness alone is not freedom. But without randomness, there would be nothing to steer.

## Conscious Selves as a Reflexive Coalition

What makes human agency distinctive is not just sensitivity to possibility, but **reflexivity**. A self models itself within the unfolding—"I am tired," "I want coffee," "I should leave soon"—and uses those models to bias its own future states.

This reflexive loop is both extrinsic and intrinsic, two aspects of the same unified process:

- **Extrinsic:** The third-person view of neurons firing, circuits activating, and networks stabilizing into a coherent state.
- **Intrinsic:** The first-person, lived sense of deliberating, weighing possibilities, and finally, of intending and choosing.

On the relational view—where the physical world itself is understood as a web of perspectives rather than a collection of absolute objects—the pattern that _is_ "what it feels like to choose" is identical with the neural dynamics of constraint and biasing, just seen from within.

But this intrinsic view is not a simple, monolithic event. The "tilting landscape of possibility" is the lived experience of our own inner complexity. It is the feeling of attention flowing toward an idea, the felt tension between competing desires, and the final "click" of resolution as a coherent path forward emerges from the noise.

Our inner world is a coalition. The self is the ongoing negotiation between subsystems: the pull of immediate reward against long-term goals, the logic of language against the wisdom of a gut feeling. The "I" that chooses is the name we give to the momentary consensus that arises when these different voices align, however briefly, to steer the whole organism. This is the intrinsic reality of downward causation: a coherent, system-level pattern that feels like a singular choice, emerging from a chorus of competing, self-relating parts.

## Why Agency Matters

This picture of agency, then, is built upon a foundation that challenges our classical intuitions. It bets that reality is fundamentally **relational**, creating facts in interaction; that the future is genuinely **open**, providing a landscape of possibility to navigate; that mind and matter are **two views of one process**, allowing our intrinsic experience to be causally potent; and that coherent wholes can exert **downward causal influence** on their parts.

Taken together, this frees agency from two false extremes:

It is not supernatural willpower, parachuting into physics from outside.

Nor is it mere epiphenomenal froth, with the real work done by molecules beneath the surface.

Agency is what happens when a coherent, self-modeling pattern learns to guide how unresolved possibilities actualize. It is causality folding back on itself, using openness as leverage.

In this light, the universe’s evolution is not just the production of new structures, but the gradual emergence of systems that can navigate their own becoming. With minds, the cosmos begins not just to unfold, but to reflect and steer.
