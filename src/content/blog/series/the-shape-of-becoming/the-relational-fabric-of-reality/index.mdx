We usually picture the world as made of objects with definite properties: a baseball has a position and momentum, a cup of coffee has a temperature and mass, a planet has an orbit and energy. These features seem to belong to the things themselves, existing whether or not anyone measures them.

Quantum mechanics unsettles this picture at the smallest scales. A familiar example is [wave-particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality): light sometimes behaves like a wave, sometimes like a particle, depending on how we measure it. The unsettling part is not that light is "secretly both," but that what shows up depends on the interaction imposed by the measuring device.

The experimental story is clear. What remains open is what it tells us about the character of reality. Do measurements collapse hidden states? Do all outcomes occur in parallel? Do properties fail to exist in isolation and only crystallize in interaction?

Of these possibilities, we'll explore the **relational** line: treat properties as facts that arise _between_ systems rather than _within_ isolated ones — and then ask what happens if we take that seriously beyond quantum experiments.

## When Reality Depends on Where You Stand

Relativity already taught us that time and length are not fixed backgrounds but quantities defined with respect to an observer's motion.

People often hear about the time side of this: the atomic clocks on GPS satellites, moving thousands of kilometers per hour around Earth, tick at a different rate than those on the ground. The spatial side is even more jarring: a meter stick racing past you is literally shorter than an identical one sitting still beside you. Not an illusion or squashing, but genuinely and measurably shorter.

Two observers moving relative to each other will disagree about both the time between events and the length of the same object — and both will be correct. There is no single true time or length waiting to be uncovered. These quantities exist only in the relationship between observer and object.

The same pattern appears elsewhere. A stationary charge produces only an electric field, but if you race past it, you'll also measure a magnetic field. What one observer calls "purely electric," another calls a mixture of electric and magnetic. Neither is wrong. The split into electric and magnetic is not an intrinsic feature of the field itself, but something that arises from how the field is sliced relative to an observer's motion.

This pattern — resolving paradox by discarding absolutes rather than multiplying unseen entities — is a core theme of modern physics.

## Quantum Reality: Facts Without Absolutes

At the quantum scale this deepens. Probabilities replace discrete facts, entangled systems replace isolated objects, and participatory observation replaces passive measurement. The challenge is not only that the rules change, but that **no single, context-independent account of reality can be given.**

These tensions aren't just philosophical; they've been tested in the lab. In 2019, a quantum-optics realization of the [Wigner's friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_friend) thought experiment showed that two photon "friends" could register incompatible outcomes about what appears to be the same event, each result holding within its own experimental frame[^1].

This was more than a curiosity. By violating a [Bell-type inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test), the experiment showed that we cannot hold onto all of our usual assumptions at once. **At least one** of the following must go:

- **Realism**: physical properties exist independently of measurement.
- **Locality**: no influence can travel faster than light.
- **Freedom of choice** (or **measurement independence**): experimenters can freely choose what to measure.

Different interpretations of quantum mechanics preserve some of these principles while discarding others:

- **Bohmian mechanics** keeps realism but sacrifices _locality_. Particles follow definite trajectories, guided by a pilot wave that connects distant systems instantaneously.
- **Superdeterminism** keeps realism and locality, but abandons _freedom of choice_. Both the system and the experimenter's decisions are seen as correlated through shared causal origins.
- **Many-Worlds (MWI)** keeps realism and locality by treating the entire wavefunction as real, with every possible outcome occurring in parallel branches. It sidesteps the conflict, but at the cost of multiplying realities and equating the mathematical formalism with physical reality.
- **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)** gives up _realism_. Properties like position or momentum do not exist universally but only relative to an observer or measuring system. This preserves both locality and freedom of choice by treating facts as fundamentally relational.

On the relational view, a definite property such as a particle's position is not _revealed_ but _created_: a fact established only in relation to the interacting system. The apparently stable, objective world is not a _pre-written stage_ but an _emergent consensus_, a woven network of relational facts that only become definite through contact.

## From Measurement to Recognition

This relational picture raises a provocative question:  
**If properties emerge through interaction rather than existing independently, what distinguishes a quantum measurement from other forms of "recognition" in nature?**

Consider what happens when a photon hits your retina. Like any quantum measurement, this interaction resolves uncertainty, and the photon's energy becomes definite _relative to_ your visual system. But something more happens. The result is integrated into cascading neural activity, compared against memory, and woven into ongoing models of the world. The initial quantum measurement becomes embedded in a far larger web of constraint and correlation.

This suggests that measurement and recognition may not be categorically different processes, but points on a **spectrum of interaction complexity.** A photodetector and an eye both resolve quantum uncertainty, but an eye does something additional: it treats that resolution as information about _something_.

What makes some correlations mechanical, while others become meaningful?

Consider three systems, each responding to its environment:

- A **thermostat** correlates with temperature through a simple threshold mechanism. When it gets cold, the heater turns on. This is correlation, but it's rigid. The thermostat has no model of temperature patterns, no memory, no anticipation. There is no navigation, only reaction.
- A **bacterium** doesn't merely respond. It integrates over time, comparing chemical concentrations to recent history. If the gradient improves, it keeps swimming; if not, it tumbles and reorients. The bacterium actively navigates a constraint landscape, using its past to inform predictions about its future.
- A **human** seeing dark clouds navigates far more complex terrain. The visual information gets integrated with weather forecasts, memories of getting caught in rain, social expectations about appearance, and personal comfort preferences. You're navigating a high-dimensional constraint landscape shot through with memory, anticipation, and competing priorities.

The bacterium and human share something the thermostat lacks: they don't just correlate with their environment — they _navigate_ it. Each reduces uncertainty and encodes that information to guide future behavior.

This is the same informational relationship seen in quantum measurement, where interaction resolves uncertainty and establishes definite correlations, now operating through biological rather than quantum-mechanical constraints.

This pattern extends beyond individual organisms. Cells, as shown in work from Michael Levin's lab at Tufts, can exhibit learning-like behaviors like habituation, sensitization, and even distributed memory[^2]. Human kidney cells habituate to optogenetic stimuli, and planarian flatworms retain trained behavioral responses even after regenerating their entire head and brain[^3]. These findings suggest that bioelectric circuits, not just neural ones, can register and store information — suggesting that constraint navigation runs through the fabric of life itself.

As systems become more sophisticated at modeling and navigating their constraints, they develop something like an internal perspective on those constraints. This is not yet _selfhood_ or _agency_ — only the faintest glimmer of _awareness_, the capacity to have a point of view at all.

Experience is what this constraint-navigation feels like from the inside. **Consciousness**, in this sense, is not something _added to_ physical processes; it **is** what certain physical processes are, when viewed from within.

## An Intrinsic Nature

This brings us to a deep divide in our picture of reality. Physics is unmatched in describing the relations and structures of matter: how particles scatter, how neurons fire, how galaxies evolve. But what it leaves untouched is the intrinsic character of those processes - the "what it is like" to undergo them.

> Put differently: physics tells us how water molecules move, but not what it feels like to be wet. It tells us which neural circuits fire when light of 450 nanometers hits the retina, but not what it is like to see the color blue. These aren't failures of science, but limits built into its method: physics deals in structure, not standpoint.

Philosophical frameworks like **Russellian Monism**[^4][^5][^6] suggest that this isn't a gap to be filled, but a clue. The extrinsic, third-person story and the intrinsic, first-person reality are not two separate domains, but _two aspects of a single process_. On this view, the felt quality of experience is not something added on top of physical activity, but the world seen from the inside.

If so, then the challenge ahead is clear: to understand minds we must not only trace the relational web of interactions, but also ask how those interactions come to possess an intrinsic standpoint at all. That question will carry us from quantum facts to selves, and finally, to the puzzle of agency.
