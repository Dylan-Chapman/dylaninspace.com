## Ant Colonies

- Why does an ant colony seem different from us? They're composed of ants, phermone trails, and the environment. We are composed of cells, neural firings, and our environment.
- We have a hard body, a skin that separates us from the world. Ant colonies have a fuzzy boundary, with ants coming and going, and pheromone trails that extend into the environment.
- We feel like we have agency at a top-down level over our cells. At first glance, ant colonies don't seem to have this top-down agency over their ants. But we don't negotiate with our white blood cells or gut bacteria either. Colonies, likewise, don't negotiate with their ants when it needs food or defense. It generates states that automatically shape their behavior.

# The Corralling of Perspectives

If Part 1 unsettled the idea of isolated things, Part 2 asks how nature builds unities. Life is not a sharp divide from non-life, but a progression of ways that many parts are constrained into coherence. What changes across this gradient is not whether matter interacts — it always does — but how strongly the whole maintains itself against disruption.

Aggregates. At the bottom, there are mere collections. A rock or a pile of sand is held together only passively: gravity, bonding, friction. If you break it apart, nothing inside the system pushes back. The unity is external, not maintained by the system itself.

Structural coherence. Crystals add a degree of order. Each new atom must align with the lattice, so the whole imposes a pattern on the parts. But if a defect arises, the crystal does not actively repair it. There is constraint, but no active maintenance.

Dynamic coherence. Certain flows organize themselves into patterns, as in Bénard convection rolls. Molecules circulate coherently, forced into large-scale order by thermal gradients. Here the whole channels the parts in real time, but the structure is fragile. Remove the gradient and the order vanishes.

Feedback coherence. Autocatalytic chemical sets deepen the pattern. Molecules catalyze one another’s formation, creating loops that can persist as long as resources flow. Now the system is actively maintaining itself through feedback. Still, it has no protection against dilution or disruption — no boundary to preserve its coherence.

Boundary coherence. Lipid vesicles enclose contents and create an inside distinct from an outside. When coupled with autocatalytic networks, this marks a real step toward life: the system now both sustains internal reactions and defends its coherence spatially. It is not yet a cell, but the logic of corralling is clear.

Predictive coherence. True cells integrate all of this. They regulate boundaries with membranes, regenerate themselves through metabolism, and preserve patterns through genetic inheritance. Most importantly, they do not just react; they anticipate. A cell’s regulatory loops predictively adjust conditions in advance, maintaining unity against entropy. At this level, coherence has become agency.

## Why Electricity?

The universe only offers two forces that act across long ranges: gravity and electromagnetism. Gravity is far too weak to matter at the scale of molecules or cells. Electromagnetism, by contrast, is overwhelmingly strong at these scales, shaping chemical bonds, protein folds, and molecular interactions. It is the natural medium of life. When organisms needed a way to coordinate across tissues, they drew on what physics already made dominant.

In multicellular life, this took the form of bioelectricity. Membrane potentials regulate flows inside single cells; gap junctions let cells share electrical state across tissues; nervous systems later scaled these same principles into high-bandwidth predictive loops. Recent work shows that bioelectric circuits can even encode distributed memories of injury or pattern, guiding regeneration and repair. In this way, electricity became not just another signaling channel but the primary substrate for corralling cells into coherent, organism-level unities.

## Corralling Evolves at Every Level

This progression is not a straight line that life climbed once. Each layer continues to evolve. Proteins change their folds, membranes evolve new transport channels, catalytic loops become more efficient. The whole constrains the parts — organisms suppress selfish cells — and the parts reshape the whole — endosymbiosis turns bacteria into mitochondria. Evolution is distributed, acting both on components and on the larger unities they form, often with nonlinear consequences. A small molecular change can reconfigure an organism’s entire development. A shift in ecosystem dynamics can drive the evolution of species traits.

What emerges is continuity. There is no single leap from dead matter to living agent, but a gradient of mechanisms by which interactions are corralled into persistence, repair, and prediction. Life is not the breaking of nature’s rules but their refinement: constraint and correlation woven into ever more resilient forms.

## The Unity of Subjectivity

Electricity did more than bind cells into tissues. It created a medium for integrated perspective. Once bioelectric signals could span a body, trillions of cells could behave as one predictive system rather than a loose collection of parts. This is why every multicellular organism begins life as a zygote: a single cell whose bioelectric and biochemical fields orchestrate development into a coherent whole. The initial unity is not lost as cells multiply — it is scaled up and actively maintained through shared electrical and chemical states.

Nervous systems later amplified this same principle. Networks of excitable cells built on the bioelectric scaffolding already present in tissues, creating high-bandwidth predictive loops that let the organism model both its environment and itself.

From here, the question shifts. If electricity corrals trillions of cells into a unified agent, what happens when the corralling itself grows recursive — when predictive loops begin modeling not just the world but the system’s own internal states? At that point, coherence takes on a new form: not just how many parts can act as one body, but how many processes can be experienced as one subject.

The sense of being a singular “I” feels obvious, yet it can loosen under sustained attention. In meditation, the narrator that normally binds experience into one voice recedes, and thoughts, sensations, and feelings arise on their own. Traditions like Buddhism, which treated these first-person investigations as their primary method, describe this not as an anomaly but as a deep truth: the self is not a substance but a process — impermanent, interdependent, and constantly maintained.

On the framework developed here, this makes sense. The unity of subjectivity is not an absolute fact but the internal perspective of a biological system corralling its parts into coherence. It can dissolve because it is always being actively constructed. In this way, the oldest phenomenological traditions converge with modern science: both reveal that what feels most immediate — the “I” — is, like all the other corrals we have traced, an achievement rather than a given, and one that can dissolve when its maintenance lapses.
