# <span class="gradient-underline">Hey! I'm Dylan</span>

I'm a physics-trained web developer from Oklahoma. My hobbies range from astrophotography, 3D printer tinkering, gaming, programming (agent/physics simulations, websites, silly apps that provide small conveniences). This is where I keep notes, test hunches, and try to sharpen the questions that won't leave me alone.

I write about whatever draws my attention - physics, cognition, biology, computation, emergence, perception, and the ways systems take on structure and meaning. Some posts are technical, some are speculative, all of them are part of my slow, ongoing attempt to understand the world and my place in it.
